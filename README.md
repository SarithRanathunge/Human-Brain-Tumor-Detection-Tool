## Introduction of the project üîçüîçüîçüîç
Detecting and understanding the presence of a brain tumor plays a critical role in the medical field. 
Currently, existing methods of brain tumor detection depend on the knowledge and expertise of a radiologist 
whose decisions are based off an MRI scan. At a glance, the radiologist cannot identify what stage this 
tumor is in and the size of the tumor. Manually, these information needs to be analysed and consulted by 
doctors to come to a final decision regarding the tumor and in this case, there is a chance of human error and 
wrong diagnosis, and it takes time which may lead to impacting the patient care. 
This project aims to solve this issue by incorporating advanced image processing techniques to enhance the 
MRI images to highlight specific tumor characteristics, segmenting tumor regions and measuring the 
dimensions using contour detection for size calculations to identify the tumor and provide additional 
information regarding the stage of the tumor and its size. Additionally, since all these analyses happen on an 
image, this project will map all the values and calculations to the original size of the brain and the tumor so 
the doctors can get an immediate idea of how big the tumor is in proportion to the brain. 
With the combinations of these enhancement methods and analysis, we aim to provide a useful solution to 
the health industry and to patient care.

## Objective of the Project üß©üß©üß©üß©
*Main Objectives *
The main objective we aim to provide is to develop a brain tumor detection system with the use of image 
processing techniques which will aim to automate the identification and analysis of tumors from an MRI 
scan.

*Specefic Objectives*
 - Develop the project using image enhancement and processing algorithms to improve the visibility 
   and the clarity of the features of the detected tumor from the scan. 
 - Implement segmentation methods that will be used to highlight the boundaries of the identified 
   tumor. 
 - We also aim to use contour detections that will be used to identify the tumor, differentiate it from the 
   overall image and use calculations to get the dimensions and size of the tumor.

## Expected Deliverables
By the completion of this project, these are the following deliverables: 
 - Web Application interface  
 - The user can upload the MRI scan 
 - Provide a diagnosis report.
